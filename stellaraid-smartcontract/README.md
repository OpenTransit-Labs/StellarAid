# 🌍 StellarAid — Decentralized Donation & Impact Protocol

A production-ready, blockchain-powered platform for transparent NGO funding, built on the Stellar network, with verifiable impact, decentralized incentives, and on-chain accountability.

---

## 📌 Overview

StellarAid combines Web2 usability with true Web3 decentralization to create a trust-first global donation infrastructure.

Donors send funds directly to NGOs using Stellar (XLM), with every transaction recorded on-chain. Volunteers contribute to real-world impact and receive verifiable rewards in the form of tokens and NFTs. The system is designed to eliminate opacity, reduce fraud, and build global trust in charitable giving.

## 🌐 What Makes It Truly Decentralized

To move beyond “Web2 + crypto” into real decentralization:

- Smart contract-based fund release using Soroban
- On-chain reward distribution (no manual backend control)
- DAO-style governance (future phase)
- IPFS storage for metadata (NFTs, reports)
- Open-source verification of all logic

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack (TypeScript-Based)

### Frontend

- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend

- Node.js (Express)
- TypeScript

### Blockchain

- Stellar SDK
- Horizon API
- Soroban (Smart Contracts)

### Storage

- PostgreSQL
- IPFS (decentralized metadata)

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. User connects wallet (Freighter)
2. Donor sends payment via Stellar
3. Transaction is recorded on-chain
4. Backend verifies via Horizon API
5. Smart contract (optional) enforces rules
6. NGO receives or unlocks funds
7. Volunteers complete tasks
8. Rewards issued (tokens/NFTs)

---

## 🔐 Security & Production Readiness

- No private key storage
- Server-side transaction verification
- Rate limiting and validation
- Secure wallet-based authentication
- Smart contract audits (recommended)
- Environment-based configuration
- Logging and monitoring (Winston / Sentry)

  Asset,
} from "stellar-sdk";

const server = new Server("https://horizon.stellar.org");

const tx = new TransactionBuilder(account, {
  fee: "100",
  networkPassphrase: Networks.PUBLIC,
})
  .addOperation(
    Operation.payment({
      destination: NGO_PUBLIC_KEY,
      asset: Asset.native(),
      amount: "10",
    }),
  )
  .setTimeout(30)
  .build();
```
